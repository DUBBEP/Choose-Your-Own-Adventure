(In the All Is Lost, the moment the hero most feared actually happens. Now it looks like the hero will lose. The All Is Lost usually contains a whiff of death where someone has died or the threat of real death is in the air. This is the hero’s rock-bottom moment..)

The caveman was fighting for air while getting tossed around by the current of the river. As the caveman tried to get air he noticed a branch low enough for him to grab. Once he grabbed the branch, he pulled his exhausted body out of the water and threw himself over by a patch of green grass.

As they tried to get ahold of this shadow, they finally caught up to it to ask about animals to hunt to feed their family. The shadowy figures seemed to sway in response.

(This is the most difficult part of the screenplay – the situation the Hero finds himself in at the midpoint where the bad guys (evil, destructive forces, either external or internal) regroup and send in the heavy guns. Internal dissent, doubt and jealousy begin to destroy the Hero’s team. The forces aligned against the Hero tighten their grip on him and begin to destroy him.)

Still looking at his feet in the puddle he glances over at his spear with a refreshing sense of hope. Suddenly thunder shakes the ground. And a flash of light followed by a loud crack ignites the sharpened piece of wood he was just looking over at.

The caveman actually wakes up this time and realizes he was dreaming, and that he hasn’t found any real exist. He’s still trapped in the dark forest and has now lost all sense of direction and he desperately looks around for that ray of light from his dreams.

In the midst of the caveman's rest the shadow came back and took the deer from the caveman saying,” Thanks for the help!”.  As the caveman tries to chase down the shadow, the shadow baits him to a cliff where there was nothing but water at the bottom. So evidently the tired caveman falls for the bait and runs off the cliff.

Now searching for both food and a way back home it is only now that the protagonist finds tracks of the deer it saw earlier. This success inspires him to lock in and continue forward. While tracking down his prey the protagonist bumps into another person. They’re short and wearing a noticeably more complex outfit than the bare loincloth of the protagonist. They share an exchange, both are cautious but realize they are both people. They both realize they are hunting the same deer. When the strange person realizes this they perk up and begin displaying a more friendly attitude. They enthusiastically show off to the protagonist. They take out a sack that they were carrying and begin taking out devices one after another. A slingshot, a mouse trap, a rope and pulley, a canteen holding water, etc. This strange person is a craftsman. The protagonist is frightened and confused by these devices initially but the friendly attitude that the craftsman displays gives them comfort and eventually they begin to display curiosity towards the contraptions. The two characters then decide to continue the hunt together.

As they enter the ominous forest the protagonist is visibly afraid, and doubting the decision to continue further into the forest. There are shown multiple scenes of the protagonist freaking out over benign things like the sound of a twig snapping or the silhouette of a tree which he mistakes for a predator. They continuously look back at the entrance of the forest which gets further and further away, before it disappears. His fate is decided by the dark of the forest.

The caveman uses the torch to find his way out of the forest and make his way back to his cave.

Stopping to catch his breath the caveman leans over looking at the ground. His feet begin to be covered in mud. Sloshing his feet in the mud, a sense of comfort begins to come over him in this mysterious region. Looking beyond his feet he sees a crystal clear puddle just Infront of him.

The story starts with a wide shot of a cave entrance in the morning in a small open area bordering a forest. It then cuts to a shot of a camp fire which sits right outside of the cave. The protagonist of the story, an adult middle-aged caveman enters the frame. They look as though they have just woken up. They yawn and begin stretching. Staring into the forest across the open space as they do. Soon the child of the caveman timidly wanders into the frame. The two share an exchange. The father looks down at their child who timidly stares down at the ground before their stomach growls. The father pats them on their head before picking up a spear and heading into the forest.

The protagonist enters the open prairie next to the forest. Scenes of wildlife roaming, including rodents and other animals. Notably, the protagonist watches a large deer with interest before the animal wanders to the edge of the prairie and enters an ominous-looking forest on the other side. The protagonist ignores this and begins searching for food. During this sequence, the food they gather is notably measly and lacking, picking up only a handful of seeds, nuts, and mushrooms. The most substantial piece of food they gather is a small rodent they hunt. This section is notable in that it shows the protagonist chasing the rodent down attempting to skewer it on their spear.
